Controls
- WASD or arrow keys to move

    - (alternatively, you can click on the GUI)
- Backspace or Escape to cancel tasks
    - (alternatively, you can click on the GUI)

Game
- you have limited energy (spoons), and so, so many tasks to complete
- tasks require you to memorize strings of numbers and type them back in
- tasks are harder when you have less energy
- you can go to sleep to replenish your spoons, but watch out! with new days come new tasks
- going into negative energy (knives) causes fatigue. sleeping won't fully replenish your energy in this case.
- if you ever reach 100 knives, you lose the game. try to avoid this!
