# Contributions
Both of us were originally part of the data team in the social proxemics research project, but most of the work for that project ended up getting done
by one or two people, leaving us without a significant amount of work to use for our final project. Because of that, we collaborated to create this game
in just five days so that we would have something to show as our final project. Because of this, we didn't really follow the main role/sub-role structure,
and both of us tended to work on different parts of the same systems. Our contributions are below.

## Sage's Contributions
- found and added all assets except for the player sprite
- created the task prefab and wrote code to make the player destroy tasks on contact
- made the player track a number of spoons that counts down over time
- created the game environment (just a single room)
- added the bed and wrote code to "start a new day" (give the player spoons and spawn more tasks) 
  on contact with it
- implemented the mechanic where lack of spoons adds a darkening overlay onto the screen
- wrote the code to handle when the player loses the game by getting to 100 knives or by reaching 25
  pending tasks
- added keyboard controls for the number-matching minigame
- wrote the README

## Lucy's Contributions
- created the player sprite from scratch
- added the position lock camera controller
- wrote the animation logic for the player sprite
- wrote logic for randomly spawning tasks
- wrote code that tracks and displays the current number of tasks
- implemented the mechanic where lack of spoons slows your movement speed
- implemented the vignette effect when spoons are low
- implemented the entirety of the number-matching minigame
- handled licenses
